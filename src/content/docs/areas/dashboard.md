The **Area Dashboard** gives you a high-level view of all advancing and scheduling activity tied to a specific physical location within your event. It closely mirrors the functionality of the Collaborator Dashboard but is scoped to the **area itself**.

### 🔄 Advance Progress Overview

In the **top left**, you’ll find the **Advance Progress** section. Here’s what you’ll see:

- **Collaborator Cards**:
  Each card represents a collaborator assigned to this area.

- **Module List**:
  Within each card, modules appear with status indicators:

  - 🟊 **Starred Modules** are required for that collaborator
  - ✅ **Progress Bars** reflect completion status
  - 🔢 **Submission Counts** show how many items have been submitted per module

This view provides an at-a-glance understanding of **who has submitted what** and **what’s still outstanding** for the area.

### 🗓️ Area Schedule

On the **right-hand side**, you'll find the **Schedule** card:

- Displays all scheduled activities specifically tied to this area
- Offers a clear timeline of what's happening and when, helping coordinate logistics and avoid conflicts

The Area Dashboard is your control center for localized advancing and scheduling—ensuring each part of your event stays on track and fully supported.
