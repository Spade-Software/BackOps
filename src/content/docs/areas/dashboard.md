The **Area Dashboard** gives you a high-level view of all advancing and scheduling activity tied to a specific physical location within your event. It closely mirrors the functionality of the Collaborator Dashboard but is scoped to the **area itself**.

---

## Advance Progress

In the **top left**, you’ll find the **Advance Progress** section. Here’s what you’ll see:

- **Collaborator Cards**:
  Each card represents a collaborator assigned to this area.

- **Module List**:
  Within each card, modules appear with status indicators:

  - **Starred Modules** are required for that collaborator
  - **Progress Bars** reflect completion status
  - **Submission Counts** show how many items have been submitted per module

This view provides an at-a-glance understanding of **who has submitted what** and **what’s still outstanding** for the area.

---

## Schedule

On the **right-hand side**, you'll find the **Schedule** card:

- Displays all scheduled activities specifically tied to this area
- Offers a clear timeline of what's happening and when, helping coordinate logistics and avoid conflicts

---

The Area Dashboard is your control center for localized advancing and scheduling—ensuring each part of your event stays on track and fully supported.
