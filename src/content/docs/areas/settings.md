The **Settings** tab allows you to manage basic configuration for each area.

## What you can do

- **Rename the Area** – Update the name of the area to reflect changes in site planning or naming conventions.

- **Delete the Area** – Remove the area from the event—**if** it is safe to do so.

  > ⚠️ **Important:** Deletion may be blocked if it would result in data loss or corruption (e.g., active advancing data or scheduled activities tied to the area).
