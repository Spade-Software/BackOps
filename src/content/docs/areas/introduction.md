**Areas** in BackOps represent **physical locations** within your event site. They act as anchors for scheduling, collaborating, and advancing workflows specific to distinct parts of your event.

---

## Area examples

Areas are customizable and reflect the actual layout of your event. Here's what they could look like:

- **For a festival**:

  - Stage 1, Stage 2
  - Artist Compound
  - Operations HQ
  - Medical Tent
  - Staff Training Zone
  - Catering Tent

- **For a corporate event**:

  - Main Session Hall
  - Breakout Room A/B/C
  - Vendor Offices
  - Afterparty Venue
  - Dining Area

By tying modules and schedules to areas, BackOps ensures everything is **context-aware**, improving clarity, planning accuracy, and operational execution.

- **Dashboard** – High-level snapshot of activity and advancing status
- **Schedule** – Calendar of events specific to that area
- **Collaborators** – Teams or vendors assigned to the area
- **Files** – Relevant documents or media for this location
- **Settings** – Configuration and naming options for the area
