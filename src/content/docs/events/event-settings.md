## Event Details

These settings define your event’s core information:

- **Name**  
  The official event title. This displays in the Events list and serves as the primary identifier throughout BackOps.

- **Location**  
  The physical or virtual venue where the event takes place (e.g., “Convention Center, Hall A” or “Zoom Webinar Room”). This appears on schedules, maps, and any location-based reports.
