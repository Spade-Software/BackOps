## 4. Configure Module Settings for Each Collaborator

1. While still in **Manage Collaborators**, locate the collaborator you want to configure.
2. Click the **Module Settings** button/icon next to their name.
3. Toggle on/off the specific modules they need access to, such as:
   - **Scheduling**
   - **Inventory**
   - **Check-In**
   - **Reporting**
4. Adjust any module-specific options as needed
5. Click **Save Settings**.

Repeat for each collaborator until everyone has the correct modules enabled.

## 5. Invite Your Team in the Collaborator User Section

1. Switch to the **Collaborator Users** tab
2. Click **Invite User**.
3. Enter:
   - **Email**: Their email address
   - **Permissions/Role**: Assign the correct access level
4. Click **Send Invitation**.  
   Each invited user will receive an email with a link to accept and join the event in BackOps.

Once your invitations are sent, monitor the “Pending” column to see who has accepted. After they join, they’ll appear under “Active Collaborators.”

Congratulations — you’ve successfully created your first event!
