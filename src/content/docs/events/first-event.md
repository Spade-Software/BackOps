## Creating Your First Event

Welcome to BackOps! If you're ready to dive in and create your first event, this guide will walk you through the initial setup step by step.

### Step 1: Sign In & Land on the Events Page

Once you've signed in, you'll land on the **Events Page**. This page lists all events you’ve created or been granted access to by others.

### Step 2: Add a New Event

Click the **Add Event** button in the top-right corner. You’ll be prompted to fill out the following:

- **Name** – The name of your event (e.g., “Sunset Music Festival 2025”).
- **Location** – The full address of your event site. This is used for shipping, weather modules, and more, so accuracy matters.
- **Default Collaborator** – This represents the primary company producing the event. If you’re the event producer, use your company name. You’ll automatically be added as the first user under that collaborator.

After submitting, you'll be redirected to the **Event Dashboard**.

### Step 3: Configure Event Settings

Navigate to the **Event Settings** (bottom-left of the sidebar), then select the **Modules** tab.
This is where you'll configure key settings for:

- Carts
- Radios
- Credentials
- Vehicles
- Labor
- Heavy Equipment

> 🔗 _[See full guide on Event Module Settings](#)_

Configuring these early ensures your advancing and procurement flows function properly.

---

### Step 4: Set Up Areas

Go to **Areas** > **Manage Areas** from the sidebar.
Click **Add Area** (top-right corner) and enter a name for each physical location on your event site (e.g., “Main Stage,” “Catering Tent,” “Ops HQ”).

You can add more later—don’t worry about getting it perfect upfront.

---

### Step 5: Add Collaborators

Navigate to **Collaborators** > **Manage Collaborators**.
Click **Add Collaborator** to begin listing all your vendors, artists, staff companies, etc.

Each collaborator represents a company working on your event.

---

### Step 6: Invite Users

Click into a collaborator, then go to **Settings** > **Users**.
Invite individuals representing that company by entering their email addresses.

If they already have a BackOps account, they’ll be added immediately. If not, they’ll receive an invitation to join.

---

### Step 7: Enable Modules for Collaborators

While inside a collaborator’s **Settings**, go to the **Modules** tab.
Enable the modules they’ll need for advancing. Mark required modules to track their progress and ensure they complete the necessary info.

---

### You’re All Set!

With your event, areas, collaborators, and module settings configured, you’re ready to begin advancing and scheduling.
