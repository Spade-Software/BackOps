Activities are the building blocks of scheduling within BackOps. They define what is happening, when it’s happening, and who needs to be involved. While activities include all the basics you’d expect from any calendar system, they also extend far beyond that, allowing you to coordinate across areas, collaborators, and users with precision.

### **Core Activity Details**

Each activity starts with the essentials:

- **Name** – A clear title for the activity.
- **Description** – A place to provide context, instructions, or details.
- **Start & End Times** – Defines when the activity begins and ends.
- **Recurrence Rules** – Configure repeating activities:

  - Daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence.
  - Specific days of the week.
  - Set an end date for the recurrence.

- **All-Day Events** – For activities that span an entire day.

These core elements form the foundation of any activity, ensuring everyone has a clear view of what’s happening and when.

### **Areas**

Activities often happen in specific locations or across multiple locations at once. BackOps allows you to associate **areas** with an activity:

- **Single Area** – Link an activity to one location (e.g., “Main Stage”).
- **Exact Location** – Add more detail within an area (e.g., “Main Stage Production Office”).
- **Multiple Areas** – For cross-location activities (e.g., testing an all-call PA system across every stage).

By associating areas, the activity will automatically appear on the calendars for those areas, making it easy to keep each team and location in sync.

### **Organizers**

Organizers determine who has permission to edit an activity.

- **Permissions** – Organizers can edit an activity; non-organizers cannot.
- **Multiple Organizers** – Assign more than one organizer to share responsibility.
- **Users vs. Collaborators** –
  - Both can be added as organizers for visibility.
  - **Only users** who are organizers receive edit permissions.

This structure ensures clarity around who controls the activity while still communicating ownership to everyone involved.

### **Participants**

Participants define who is expected (or invited) to an activity:
- **Required** – Users or collaborators who must attend.
- **Optional** – Users or collaborators who should be aware of the activity but are not required.

Adding a collaborator or user as a participant automatically places the activity on their schedule, ensuring nothing gets missed.

### **Global Activities**

Marking an activity as **global** places it on the event-level calendar, giving it maximum visibility across the platform.

- **When to Use:**
  - Event-wide meetings.
  - Major milestones (e.g., doors open/close).
  - Safety-related cutoffs or site lock downs.

Global activities ensure that mission-critical information is front and center for the entire production team.

### **The Power of Activities in BackOps**

By combining areas, organizers, participants, and global visibility, activities give production teams a single, unified way to coordinate complex event schedules. Instead of duplicating events or managing conflicting calendars, BackOps ensures everyone is aligned with minimal effort and maximum clarity.
