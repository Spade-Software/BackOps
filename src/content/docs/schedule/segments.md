- **Custom columns**: Add your own fields (e.g., Department, Responsible Party, Equipment Notes) to tailor the segment table to your workflow.

- **Color coding**: Organize segments visually using color highlights.
  - Click the ⚙️ gear icon → Edit → Select color.

### Note: Experimental Feature

Segments are still in early development and will evolve based on user feedback. That said, they’re already a powerful tool for teams who need granular control over key show elements.

BackOps makes it easy to manage your event minute-by-minute—or even second-by-second.
