In live event production, timing is everything. Whether it’s coordinating rehearsals, loading in equipment, or managing crew calls, keeping everyone aligned on **when and where they need to be** is critical. The BackOps Scheduling module brings structure to this complexity by centralizing all time-based activities into a single, intuitive system.

### **Multiple Schedules for Total Clarity**

To make sure every part of your event is properly tracked, BackOps supports several types of schedules:

- **Event Schedule** – The master calendar that shows all event-wide activities.
- **Collaborator Schedules** – Dedicated schedules for each collaborator, giving clear visibility into their specific commitments.
- **Area Schedules** – Focused calendars for each area (e.g., stage, compound, or production zone) to avoid conflicts and streamline operations.
- **User Schedule** – A personal view showing only the activities that you, as a user, have been invited to.

This layered approach ensures that you can see everything at a high level—or drill down to the details that matter most.

### **Mix-and-Match Flexibility**

Scheduling in BackOps is designed to be **highly flexible**. You can combine or filter schedules to view only what’s relevant to you. For example, a stage manager can view the event schedule alongside the area schedule for their stage, while a crew member might focus solely on their personal schedule. This mix-and-match capability makes it easy to stay organized without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

### **One Activity, Many Calendars**

Instead of creating the same event in multiple places, BackOps lets you create **a single activity** and associate it with the event, specific collaborators, areas, and even individual users. This ensures everyone sees the same information, in the right place, without duplication.

### **The Result: Organized, Conflict-Free Scheduling**

With filtering, association, and consolidated activity creation, the Scheduling module ensures that:

- Everyone knows where they need to be.
- Schedules stay clear and manageable.
- Teams can collaborate without endless calendar updates or conflicting events.

This is your single source of truth for all event timing—scalable, organized, and built specifically for the demands of live event production.
