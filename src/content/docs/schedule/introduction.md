**Schedule** is the backbone of event timing in BackOps. It allows you to plan, view, and manage **Activities** (our term for individual scheduled items) across all parts of your production.

---

## Where schedules appear

Schedules are integrated across the platform and can be linked to:

- **Areas** — e.g., Stage 1, VIP Tent, Ops HQ
  → View and manage activities happening in specific zones.

- **Collaborators** — e.g., Artists, Vendors, Production Teams
  → See activities relevant only to that collaborator (e.g., load-ins, advance calls).

- **Event** — The global view showing all activities across your event footprint.

All schedule views follow the same layout and share a consistent user experience.

## What you can do

- **Filter by Timeframe**: Switch between **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** views to control the calendar zoom level.

- **Add Activities**

  - **Click + Add** (top-right corner) to create a new item manually
  - **Click & Drag** on the calendar to block out time and pre-fill start/end times

- **Color Coding**: Activities are color-coded based on what they’re attached to:

  - Area-based
  - Collaborator-based
  - Event

---

## Editing activities

Click on any activity to open its options:

1. **Edit**

   - Rename
   - Change start/end time
   - Delete

2. **Segments**

   - Attach detailed sub-events or breakdowns (explained in its own section)

---

This flexible, visual scheduling system ensures everyone knows what’s happening, when, and where—helping you keep the chaos of live events under control.
