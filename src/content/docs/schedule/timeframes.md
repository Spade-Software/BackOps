Time Frames in BackOps provide **contextual highlights** over your calendars. Unlike activities, which represent specific scheduled events, time frames act as **visual overlays** that define different phases or conditions of your event, making it easier to navigate and understand what’s happening at any given point.

### **What are time frames used for?**

Time frames can be used in a variety of ways to add structure and clarity to your event schedule. Examples include:

- **Event Phases:** Marking **Load-In**, **Show Days**, and **Load-Out** so it’s visually clear which stage of the event you're in.
- **Access Restrictions:** Highlighting periods during which **vehicle traffic is not permitted** or certain zones are restricted.
- **Travel Context:** For cruise or other moving productions, creating time frames for **“At Sea”** days or for each port stop.
- **Other Contextual Cues:** Any background information that helps your team quickly understand the timeline without cluttering the calendar with extra activities.

These highlights don’t replace activities—they provide additional **context** that runs in the background.

### **Time Frame Details**

When creating a time frame, you can define:

- **Name** – The label for the time frame (e.g., “Load-In,” “At Sea,” “Show Day 1”).
- **Description** – Optional details or notes to clarify what the time frame represents.
- **Start & End** – Define the date or date range for the time frame.
- **Areas (Optional)** – Associate the time frame with specific areas (e.g., only shade the calendar for “Main Stage” if the time frame applies to that area).
- **Participants (Optional)** – Assign time frames to specific collaborators or users, to ensure the time frame appears on their calendar.
- **Global** – Mark a time frame as global to make it visible across the entire event calendar.

⚠ **Important:** Time frames do **not** support recurrence. They are one-off periods of time that act as context markers.

### **Navigation with Time Frames**

One of the most powerful features of time frames is that they create **jump points** in the calendar sidebar.

- For example, if you create time frames for:

  - Load-In
  - Show Day 1
  - Show Day 2
  - Load-Out

You will now see **quick navigation buttons** in the calendar sidebar for each of these time frames, making it easy to jump to exactly where you need to be in the event timeline.

This is especially helpful for large, multi-day events where navigating through the calendar day by day would otherwise be time-consuming.

### **When to Use Time Frames**

We recommend setting up time frames early in your event setup to:

- Provide **visual context** for your team.
- Simplify **calendar navigation** with jump points.
- Help collaborators immediately understand the phase of the event at any point in time.

Even if you only add the basics (e.g., Load-In, Show Days, Load-Out), these markers significantly improve calendar usability and reduce scheduling confusion.
