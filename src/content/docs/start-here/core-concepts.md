## 🧱 Core Concepts of BackOps

To understand how BackOps works, it’s important to first understand how the platform is structured. Everything in BackOps revolves around three core concepts:

---

### 🎟️ 1. Events

An **Event** is the central container in BackOps. Everything that happens—from planning to execution—is organized under an event.

Think of it as the _project_ you're working on. It could be:

- A music festival
- A corporate event
- A touring production
- A birthday party
- A film shoot

Each event has its own collaborators, areas, data, documents, and workflows—all self-contained to keep operations focused and organized.

---

### 👥 2. Collaborators

**Collaborators** are the people and companies involved in making your event happen.

BackOps uses a flexible structure where:

- A **Collaborator** represents a company or vendor (e.g., a lighting vendor, artist management firm, catering service).
- Each collaborator can have one or more **Users**—individuals who log into the platform and perform tasks on behalf of that company.

Collaborators could include:

- Artists and their teams
- Production companies
- Venue staff
- Operations crews
- Food and beverage vendors
- Security teams

This model allows you to build out a shared workspace where each participant has the right level of access and responsibility.

### 📍 3. Areas

**Areas** represent the physical or logical spaces that make up your event site.

You can think of them as **zones** or **locations** where work needs to be planned, assigned, or tracked. Common examples include:

- **Stages** (e.g., Main Stage, Side Stage)
- **Breakout Rooms** (for corporate events)
- **Backstage Zones** (e.g., artist lounge, green rooms)
- **Staff Support Areas** (e.g., catering tents, volunteer check-in, medical tents)

Defining areas allows your team to coordinate operations, assign resources, and track activities based on location.

These three concepts—**Events**, **Collaborators**, and **Areas**—are the foundation of BackOps. Every feature in the platform connects back to one of these.

Here’s a concise summary you can place on the **Core Concepts** page to introduce Modules before directing users to the full section:

### 🧩 Modules (Quick Overview)

**Modules** are how BackOps delivers functionality to your event—like requesting gear, submitting credentials, managing labor, or tracking technical needs. They work across **Events**, **Collaborators**, and **Areas**, adapting to the structure of your show.

Modules come in two types:

- **Global Modules** apply event-wide (e.g., Radios, Vehicles, Credentials)
- **Area Modules** apply to specific zones (e.g., Audio for Stage A, Power for VIP)

Each collaborator only sees the modules they need—keeping the experience clean, relevant, and efficient.
