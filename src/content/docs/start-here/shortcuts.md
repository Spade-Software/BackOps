To streamline data entry and reduce friction during workflows, BackOps includes several keyboard and input shortcuts. These shortcuts are designed to help power users move faster.

## Natural Language Date & Time Parsing

You can enter common phrases in date/time fields, and BackOps will automatically convert them into a proper date-time format. Some examples include:

- `tomorrow night`
- `next week at 7pm`
- `friday at noon`
- `in 3 days`

This feature allows you to type naturally without worrying about strict formatting.

## Save Shortcut

To quickly submit a form without reaching for the mouse, use the following shortcut:

- **Mac:** `⌘ + Enter`
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Enter`

This will trigger the form's primary action (typically a Save or Submit button).

## "Create More" Mode

When enabled, the **Create More** toggle lets you immediately open a new, blank form after saving the current one. This is ideal when entering multiple entries in succession—like adding tasks, line items, or requests.

- After each save, the dialog resets and stays open
- Helps avoid repetitive clicks and modal reopenings

## Global Search Shortcut

BackOps includes a powerful global search component that allows users to search across all areas and collaborators on the current event. You can open this search from anywhere in the app using the following shortcut:

- **Mac:** `⌘ + K`
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + K`

This brings up the search overlay, allowing quick navigation and access to relevant data without clicking through menus.
