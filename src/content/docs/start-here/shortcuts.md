To streamline data entry and reduce friction during workflows, BackOps includes several keyboard and input shortcuts. These shortcuts are designed to help power users move faster.

## Natural Language Date & Time Parsing

You can enter common phrases in date/time fields, and BackOps will automatically convert them into a proper date-time format. Some examples include:

- `tomorrow night`
- `next week at 7pm`
- `friday at noon`
- `in 3 days`

This feature allows you to type naturally without worrying about strict formatting.

## Save Shortcut

To quickly submit a form without reaching for the mouse, use the following shortcut:

- **Mac:** `⌘ + Enter`
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Enter`

This will trigger the form's primary action (typically a Save or Submit button).

## "Create More" Mode

When enabled, the **Create More** toggle lets you immediately open a new, blank form after saving the current one. This is ideal when entering multiple entries in succession—like adding tasks, line items, or requests.

- After each save, the dialog resets and stays open
- Helps avoid repetitive clicks and modal reopenings
