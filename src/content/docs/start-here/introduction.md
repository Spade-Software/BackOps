BackOps is a modular platform that centralizes workflows for live event operations. Whether you’re running a weekend festival, corporate event, or multi-city tour, BackOps brings clarity to every operational layer.

**BackOps is your command center for live event operations.**

Most tools in the live entertainment industry weren’t built for these workflows. They were retrofitted, borrowed, or forced to fit processes they were never designed to support. The result:

- Scattered spreadsheets and endless email threads
- Fragmented communication between producers, vendors, and crew
- Workarounds that add complexity instead of solving it

We believe it’s time for something different.

BackOps is built by industry insiders and software experts with one mission in mind: **To give live event teams the tools they actually need to plan, execute, and deliver exceptional experiences.**

Here’s what you’ll find in the docs:

- Clear explanations of core concepts like events, areas, and collaborators
- Step-by-step guides for using each module
- Best practices for streamlined collaboration
- Tips for configuring BackOps to fit your event’s unique needs

If you’re ready to start building smoother shows, tighter operations, and cleaner comms— you’re in the right place.
