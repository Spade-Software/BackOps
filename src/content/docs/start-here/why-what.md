## 🎬 Why BackOps?

In live entertainment, the show must go on—but the **software to support it has never been center stage.**

Most of the tools used across the entertainment industry weren’t built for it.
They were retrofitted. Borrowed. Forced to fit workflows they were never designed to support.

We believe it’s time for something different.

### 💡 Our Philosophy

BackOps is being built by **Spade Software**, a company founded on one simple idea:

> _When you pair world-class software experts with industry veterans who’ve lived the challenges firsthand, you can build something exceptional._

This isn’t theory for us—it’s practice.
Our team includes:

- **Veterans of the entertainment world** with 15+ years of on-the-ground production experience, and
- **Elite engineers** who’ve led development at companies like IBM and built systems used by Fortune 500 clients.

Together, we’re building software that **doesn’t just check boxes—it actually makes sense** for how live events are run.

### 🎯 Our “Why”

We’re not here because we saw a gap in the market.
We’re here because we’ve _lived_ the problem.

The entertainment industry deserves tools that are:

- Purpose-built **from the ground up**
- Grounded in **real production experience**
- Designed with **true user empathy**
- Supported by **modern, scalable technology**

BackOps is our answer.
A platform built for **producers, stage managers, vendors, techs, coordinators, and operations teams**—by people who’ve actually been in those roles.

Our mission is to make BackOps the trusted infrastructure behind your event, show, tour, or production.

## 🔭 BackOps Vision

BackOps is built with one goal in mind:
**To be the complete end-to-end platform for live event operations.**

Whether you’re planning a weekend festival, managing a multi-city tour, or producing a one-day shoot, BackOps is designed to power every stage of your production—from pre-show prep to post-show wrap.

### 🚀 What We’re Building Toward

We’re actively evolving BackOps into a centralized platform where all stakeholders—organizers, vendors, crew, and production teams—can collaborate in real time. Our vision includes:

- **Seamless Show Planning & Advancing**
  Centralize everything from technical riders to contact lists, with workflows for approvals and updates.

- **Vendor Coordination, Approvals & Procurement**
  Streamline communication, track quotes, manage vendor onboarding, and lock in agreements faster.

- **On-Site Labor Tracking & Time Management**
  Monitor hours, assign roles, and manage timecards in real-time for all crew on site.

- **Live Show Build & Execution Monitoring**
  Get a live view of build progress, task completions, and issue resolution as your site comes together.

- **Travel & Logistics Management**
  Organize airport pickups, hotel arrangements, equipment logistics, and internal transportation.

- **Transportation Operations**
  Coordinate routes, schedules, and communications for team and vendor movements.

- **Asset Tracking Across Locations**
  Manage gear check-in/out, prevent loss, and maintain accountability across departments.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**
  Ensure mobile and desktop users stay synced—from the production office to the front gate.

BackOps is more than just a tool—it’s the **operational backbone** for your live productions.

## 🧭 What is BackOps?

**BackOps is your command center for live event operations.**

It’s a modern, modular platform built to manage everything behind the scenes—from artist advancing to on-site logistics to post-show wrap-up.

At its core, BackOps is designed to:

- Replace scattered spreadsheets and endless email threads

With BackOps, you can:

- Build out events and define the people and areas that make them happen
- Assign precise modules to collaborators based on what they actually need to do
