In live entertainment, the show must go on—but the **software to support it has never been center stage.**

Most of the tools used across the entertainment industry weren’t built for it. They were retrofitted. Borrowed. Forced to fit workflows they were never designed to support.

## Our “Why”

We’re not here because we saw a gap in the market.
We’re here because we’ve _lived_ the problem.

The entertainment industry deserves tools that are:

- Purpose-built **from the ground up**
- Grounded in **real production experience**
- Designed with **true user empathy**
- Supported by **modern, scalable technology**

BackOps is our answer.
A platform built for **producers, stage managers, vendors, techs, coordinators, and operations teams**—by people who’ve actually been in those roles.

Our mission is to make BackOps the trusted infrastructure behind your event, show, tour, or production.


## Our Philosophy
BackOps is being built by Spade Software, a company founded on one simple idea:

> _When you pair world-class software experts with industry veterans who’ve lived the challenges firsthand, you can build something exceptional._

This isn’t theory for us—it’s practice. Our team includes:
- **Veterans of the entertainment world** with 15+ years of on-the-ground production experience
- **Elite engineers** who’ve led development at companies like IBM and built systems used by Fortune 500 clients

Together, we’re building software that **doesn’t just check boxes—it actually makes sense** for how live events are run.
