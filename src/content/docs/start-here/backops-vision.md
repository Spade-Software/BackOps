BackOps is built with one goal in mind:
**To be the complete end-to-end platform for live event operations.**

Whether you’re planning a weekend festival, managing a multi-city tour, or producing a one-day shoot, BackOps is designed to power every stage of your production—from pre-show prep to post-show wrap.

## What We’re Building Toward

We’re actively evolving BackOps into a centralized platform where all stakeholders—organizers, vendors, crew, and production teams—can collaborate in real time. Here's what we have in store:

- **Seamless Show Planning & Advancing**
  Centralize everything from technical riders to contact lists, with workflows for approvals and updates.

- **Vendor Coordination, Approvals & Procurement**
  Streamline communication, track quotes, manage vendor onboarding, and lock in agreements faster.

- **On-Site Labor Tracking & Time Management**
  Monitor hours, assign roles, and manage timecards in real-time for all crew on site.

- **Live Show Build & Execution Monitoring**
  Get a live view of build progress, task completions, and issue resolution as your site comes together.

- **Travel & Logistics Management**
  Organize airport pickups, hotel arrangements, equipment logistics, and internal transportation.

- **Transportation Operations**
  Coordinate routes, schedules, and communications for team and vendor movements.

- **Asset Tracking Across Locations**
  Manage gear check-in/out, prevent loss, and maintain accountability across departments.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**
  Ensure mobile and desktop users stay synced—from the production office to the front gate.

BackOps is more than just a tool—it’s the **operational backbone** for your live productions.
