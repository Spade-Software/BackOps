## Module types

In BackOps, not all modules behave the same way. To better support the real-world needs of live event logistics, modules are categorized into two distinct types:

- **Global Modules**
- **Area Modules**

Understanding the difference is key to properly assigning and configuring functionality across your event.

## Global modules

Global Modules are used across the entire event and are not tied to a specific area. These modules represent functions or resources that either:

- Span multiple physical zones (e.g., radios used site-wide), or
- Simply don’t make sense to restrict to a location (e.g., credentials or package notifications).

### Examples of global modules

- Heavy Equipment Requests  
- Radio Requests  
- Credential Requests  
- Guest Lists  
- Labor Management  
- Vehicle Registration  
- Golf Carts / Utility Carts  
- Package Notifications  

These modules allow users to make requests, submit forms, or interact with workflows at the event-wide level, no matter where the activity happens.

## Area modules

Area modules are tied directly to specific locations within your event. These modules are used when context matters—like knowing which stage needs backline, or where a specific power drop will be installed.

### Examples of area modules

- Audio  
- Video  
- Lighting  
- Power  
- Backline  
- Special Effects (SFX)  
- Staging  
- Hospitality  
- Gear Requests  

When a collaborator uses an Area Module, they’ll be doing so in the context of a specific area. This ensures precise planning and operational clarity.

## Assigning module access

You can configure module access for collaborators in two ways:

| Type    | Assigned By                      | Example Use Case                                                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Module  | On a per-collaborator basis      | A food vendor needs to request radios and submit vehicle info                              |
| Area Module    | On a per-collaborator, per-area basis | A stage manager needs to submit power and lighting requests for Main Stage, but only audio for Side Stage |

This flexible permissions model ensures that:

- Users only see the tools relevant to them  
- No one is overwhelmed by features they don’t need  
- Planners can maintain tight control over operational workflows
