The **Carts module** is a **global module** used to manage and track cart requests across your event. Carts are a common on-site transport method in the live entertainment industry, and this module ensures teams and collaborators have what they need to get around efficiently.

---

## Purpose

Carts are critical for on-site mobility—especially on large sites or multi-day events. This module enables collaborators to:

- Request the carts they’ll need in advance
- Specify the type and purpose of each cart
- Share timing to help with pickup scheduling and capacity planning

---

## Fields

When submitting a new cart request, collaborators will be prompted to provide:

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**   | A label for the cart—used to identify its purpose or assigned team (e.g., “Lighting Team”, “Production Cart #1”, “Artist Transport”) |
| **Type**   | Selectable from a list created by the **event administrator** (e.g., 4-Passenger, Utility Cart, Side-by-Side, 6-Passenger)           |
| **Pickup** | The date the team expects to receive or begin using the cart                                                                         |
| **Return** | The date the cart will be returned or no longer needed                                                                               |

> 🔧 _All cart types are configurable per event. Event administrators define what kinds of carts are available for request._

---

## Configuration (Admins)

- **Cart Types**: Define all types of carts collaborators can choose from, based on availability or rental inventory.
- **Module Access**: Enable the Carts module only for collaborators who require it.
- **Scheduling Visibility**: Use request timing to inform distribution, transport planning, and cart fleet logistics.

---

## Use Cases

- Ensuring production, security, and vendor teams have sufficient on-site mobility
- Managing pickup and return timelines to reduce idle cart time
- Forecasting cart inventory needs based on total event-wide requests
