The **Credentials module** is a **global module** used to manage access passes, wristbands, badges, and other credentials for collaborators entering your event site.

It‚Äôs designed to ensure that every person on-site is properly identified, approved, and granted the correct level of access‚Äîsupporting both security protocols and logistical coordination.

---

## Purpose

From crew wristbands to artist laminates, credentials control who gets where, and when. The Credentials module enables collaborators to:

- Submit mass credential requests for their teams
- Specify credential types
- Provide pickup contact information for accountability and tracking

This module streamlines access management and helps prevent unauthorized site access.

## Fields

Each credential request includes the following fields:

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
