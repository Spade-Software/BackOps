The **Audio module** is an **area module** used primarily in the **artist advancing process**, enabling precise coordination between artists, production teams, and event organizers around audio staffing and gear.

It operates using **Production Advance Responses**—a standardized format for declaring who is **providing** and who is **paying** for each element of the audio setup.

This module ensures all parties are aligned on:

- Staffing (e.g., engineers)
- Gear responsibilities (e.g., consoles, IEMs)
- Procurement and rental approvals
- Logistical needs per area (e.g., Main Stage, Breakout Room, etc.)

### 📋 Fields in the Audio Module

Each of the following seven fields uses a **Production Advance Response** (Provider + Payer):

| Field                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-of-House Engineer** | Declares whether the FOH engineer will be provided by the house, artist, or not needed—and who is responsible for paying for that role. |
| **Front-of-House Console**  | Identifies who is supplying the FOH console and paying for it. Also includes a field to specify the **console model** or name.          |
| **Monitor Engineer**        | Specifies the staffing responsibility and payment source for the monitor engineer.                                                      |
| **Monitor Console**         | Lists who is bringing the monitor console, who’s paying, and optionally the **console model**.                                          |
| **In-Ear Monitors (IEMs)**  | Tracks IEM package responsibilities and payments, typically for wireless in-ear monitoring systems.                                     |
| **RF Package**              | Covers microphones and other wireless RF needs. Indicates provider and payer responsibilities.                                          |
| **Mic Package (Non-RF)**    | Details all standard microphones (non-RF). Again, uses the Provider/Payer format.                                                       |

### 📦 Line Item Tracking & Procurement

For the following five fields, collaborators can also add **line items**—specific gear requests that enter the **resource procurement and approval process**:

- Front-of-House Console
- Monitor Console
- In-Ear Monitors (IEMs)
- RF Package
- Mic Package

Each line item includes:

- **Item Name** (e.g., Shure SM58, Digico SD10)
- **Quantity**
- **Attached Approval Workflow** (to confirm house procurement, artist-provided status, or shared cost)

> 📝 _See [Resource Approval Process](#) for more on how line items are reviewed and approved._

---

### 🗒️ Notes Field

A freeform **Notes** section is available at the end of the module, allowing collaborators to:

- Add context or clarifications
- Provide links to external riders or documents
- Call out exceptions, substitutions, or special needs

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- A headlining artist flies in with their own engineers and consoles, but needs the house to supply IEMs and RF gear—paid by the artist.
- A local act uses all house-supplied audio gear and staffing—paid for by the festival.
- A touring act submits a full console and mic list for approval as part of a buyout or hybrid support model.
