The **Lighting module** is an **area-based module** used in the **artist advancing process** to define responsibilities, gear requirements, and staffing needs related to lighting.

It ensures that both the house and the artist are aligned on who is supplying what‚Äîand who‚Äôs covering the cost‚Äîby using the **Production Advance Response** model for each element.

This module helps avoid confusion during load-in and showtime, and supports centralized procurement planning when house-supplied gear is involved.
