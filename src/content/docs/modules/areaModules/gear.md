The **Gear module** is an **area-based catch-all module** used to request and track **miscellaneous gear** that doesn’t fall neatly into categories like audio, video, or staging.

It’s ideal for capturing those “last 10%” requests—things like screens, stands, cables, signage, or anything needed to make an area fully functional.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

Not every gear need fits neatly into a standard module. The Gear module allows collaborators to:

- Request support gear for technical setups, admin areas, or special use cases
- Make sure miscellaneous equipment is documented, tracked, and ordered
- Prevent day-of surprises by capturing overlooked items early in planning

### 📋 Fields in the Gear Module

Each gear request is submitted as a **Gear Line Item**, with the following fields:

| Field           | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Item Name**   | What gear is being requested (e.g., “50-inch TV”, “Truss Upright”, “HDMI Cable”)                  |
| **Description** | Optional details or specifications (e.g., “For training video loop”, “Needs base plate included”) |
| **Quantity**    | Number of units needed                                                                            |

> 📝 _This module feeds into the standard [Procurement and Approval Workflow](#), ensuring every item gets reviewed, fulfilled, and accounted for._

### 🛠️ Configuration Options (for Admins)

- **Flexible Access**: Enable this module in **any area** where gear might be needed—from crew tents to breakouts to backstage zones.
- **Approval Routing**: Route gear requests to staging, tech, or warehouse teams as needed.
- **Labeling** _(optional future feature)_: Tag gear by category (e.g., electrical, signage, support gear) for easier filtering and tracking.

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- A **staff training area** needs a screen, truss mount, and HDMI cable for presentation playback
- A **VIP entrance tent** needs signage stands, lighting fixtures, and extension cords
- A **backstage green room** needs a mirror, table, and folding chairs

### 🧩 Why It Matters

The Gear module ensures that **nothing falls through the cracks**—because often it’s not the big things, but the missing small ones, that disrupt the day.
