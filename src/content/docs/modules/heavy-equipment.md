The **Heavy Equipment module** is a **global module** used to manage requests for heavy machinery on-site. From forklifts to boom lifts, this tool helps organizers plan equipment needs efficiently—reducing cost, overlap, and logistical friction.

---

## Purpose

Heavy equipment is critical for setup, teardown, and ongoing site operations. This module enables collaborators to:

- Request the equipment they need for their team or department
- Specify what type of equipment and when it’s needed
- Support smart resource planning by sharing scheduling info

---

## Fields

When collaborators submit a request, they’ll provide:

| Field              | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Equipment Name** | A name to help identify the use case or team (e.g., “Production Forklift”, “Stage Left Boomlift”, “Fencing Crew Loader”) |
| **Equipment Type** | Select from a list of types configured by the **event admin** (e.g., Forklift, Scissorlift, Boomlift, Frontloader)       |
| **Pickup Date**    | The day the equipment is needed on site                                                                                  |
| **Return Date**    | The day the equipment is expected to be released or returned                                                             |

> 🛠️ _All equipment types are configurable by the event administrator based on what’s available or being rented._
