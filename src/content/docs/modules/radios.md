The **Radio module** is a **global module** used to manage communication equipment requests across your event. Radios are often centrally provided by the production team to ensure seamless, unified communication among staff, vendors, and crew.

---

## Purpose

Radios are a mission-critical tool for real-time coordination on site. The Radio module enables collaborators to:

- Request the communication gear they need for their teams
- Specify the number and type of devices required
- Coordinate pickup and return logistics

By centralizing these requests, event organizers avoid the chaos of unmanaged, mismatched radio systems being brought in by separate teams.

---

## Fields

Each request includes the following fields:

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Quantity**              | The number of radios or packages requested (e.g., “14” for a full team)                                                                                                      |
| **Pickup Date**           | When the radios are needed to be picked up on site                                                                                                                           |
| **Return Date**           | When the radios are expected to be returned or decommissioned                                                                                                                |

> 💡 _Radio types and accessory packages are fully configurable per event by the administrator._

## Configuration (Admins)

- **Radio & Accessory Types**: Build out custom radio kits or communication gear packages for your team.
- **Access Controls**: Limit module visibility to collaborators with approved communication needs.
- **Inventory Forecasting** _(optional future feature)_: Use quantity and timing to plan inventory needs and rental scaling.

---

## Use Cases

- Enabling production crews, security, medical, or operations staff to coordinate in real-time
- Providing radios to external vendors for situational awareness
- Scheduling and managing large-scale radio pickups and returns to avoid bottlenecks
