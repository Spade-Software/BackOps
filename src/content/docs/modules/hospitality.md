The **Hospitality module** is an **area module** used to define and track **hospitality needs** for artists, speakers, staff, or collaborators. From green room snacks to backstage beverages, this module gives teams a clear, itemized list of what’s required and where.

This module is designed to streamline fulfillment of **hospitality riders** and ensure on-site teams have full visibility into comfort-related requests.

---

## Purpose

Whether you’re managing artist requests for champagne and Red Bull, or supporting a speaker session with bottled water and granola bars, the Hospitality module helps:

- Centralize and document requests
- Prevent miscommunication and oversights
- Ensure hospitality items are delivered to the right area, on time

## Fields

Each request is submitted as a **hospitality line item**. Collaborators can submit multiple items in a single module entry.

| **Description** | Optional field to provide detail or preferences (e.g., “Mostly berries, no melon”, “Sparkling water only”, “12 oz cans”)                                     |
