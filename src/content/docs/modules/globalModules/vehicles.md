The **Vehicles module** is a **global module** in BackOps, used to track and manage all vehicles a collaborator plans to bring on site. This helps production teams manage access, credentials, parking, and logistics throughout the event lifecycle.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

Whether it’s a tour bus, box truck, SUV, or golf cart, the Vehicles module allows collaborators to:

- Register their vehicles
- Assign credential levels
- Share arrival and departure timing
- Provide identifying details for security, traffic, and site operations

---

### 📋 Adding a Vehicle

When a collaborator adds a new vehicle, they’ll be prompted to enter:

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vehicle Name**              | Freeform label to identify the vehicle (e.g., “Lighting Semi #2”, “FOH Van”, “Tour Bus – Artist A”)                                               |
| **Vehicle Type**              | Selectable from a list defined by the **event admin** (e.g., SUV, 52' Side Truck, Golf Cart, Tour Bus)                                            |
| **Credential Type**           | Defines the **level of access** the vehicle has on site (e.g., Basic Parking, Site Roaming, All Access). These types are also event-configurable. |
| **Arrival / Departure Dates** | Optional fields to help logistics teams manage **parking plans** and **gate flow** across the event timeline.                                     |

> 🚧 _Note: Vehicle types and credential types are fully configurable per event by an administrator._
