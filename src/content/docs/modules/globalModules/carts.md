## 🛺 Golf Carts Module

The **Golf Carts module** is a **global module** used to manage and track golf cart requests across your event. Golf carts are a common on-site transport method in the live entertainment industry, and this module ensures teams and collaborators have what they need to get around efficiently.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

Golf carts are critical for on-site mobility—especially on large sites or multi-day events. This module enables collaborators to:

- Request the carts they’ll need in advance
- Specify the type and purpose of each cart
- Share timing to help with pickup scheduling and capacity planning

---

### 📋 Submitting a Cart Request

When submitting a new golf cart request, collaborators will be prompted to provide:

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cart Name**   | A label for the cart—used to identify its purpose or assigned team (e.g., “Lighting Team”, “Production Cart #1”, “Artist Transport”) |
| **Cart Type**   | Selectable from a list created by the **event administrator** (e.g., 4-Passenger, Utility Cart, Side-by-Side, 6-Passenger)           |
| **Pickup Date** | The date the team expects to receive or begin using the cart                                                                         |
| **Return Date** | The date the cart will be returned or no longer needed                                                                               |

> 🔧 _All cart types are configurable per event. Event administrators define what kinds of carts are available for request._
