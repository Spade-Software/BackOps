## üë∑ Labor Module

The **Labor module** is a **global module** used to manage on-site labor requests from collaborators. Whether for load-in, setup, operations, or teardown, this module helps event organizers coordinate staffing needs across departments‚Äîensuring the right people are in the right place at the right time.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

Most events provide labor centrally‚Äîthis module is how collaborators submit **labor calls** to request that support.

The module allows collaborators to:

- Define their labor needs by role and quantity
- Specify time windows for support
- Centralize communication with labor coordinators and ops teams

---

### üìã Submitting a Labor Request

Labor requests are submitted as **labor calls**, each representing a single work block.

Each labor call includes:

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Labor Call Name**          | A short title describing the task (e.g., ‚ÄúStage A Load-In‚Äù, ‚ÄúVendor Booth Setup‚Äù, ‚ÄúCable Run Support‚Äù)                                                                              |
| **Start Time**               | When the requested labor should begin                                                                                                                                               |
| **End Time**                 | When the requested labor is no longer needed                                                                                                                                        |
| **Labor Roles & Quantities** | A breakdown of how many people are needed by role. Each entry includes: <br> - **Role Type** (e.g., Laborer, Rigger, Operator, Lead, Truck Loader) <br> - **Quantity** of each type |

> üîß _Labor types are fully configurable by the event admin based on the event's unique needs and terminology._

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Coordinating central labor for production and vendor teams
- Allowing vendors to submit precise needs without direct ops involvement
- Giving labor managers full visibility to organize shifts and build call sheets

The Labor module acts as the **operational bridge between planners and boots-on-the-ground support**. It turns scattered labor requests into a unified staffing plan‚Äîkeeping your show on schedule and well-resourced.
