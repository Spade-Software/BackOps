## 🎫 GuestList Module

The **GuestList module** is a **global module** used to manage artist guest entries for events. Unlike staff or crew credentials, guest list entries are used to grant **patron-level access** to individuals attending on behalf of a performer or collaborator.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

Artists, managers, and other collaborators are often allocated a set number of guest passes in their contracts or riders. The GuestList module provides a simple way to:

- Register those guests in advance
- Ensure access is granted at the box office
- Avoid day-of confusion or miscommunications

> 🎟️ _This module is distinct from the Credentials module, which is used for staff/crew access. GuestList is strictly for attendees arriving as patrons._

### 📋 Submitting a Guest Entry

Each guest entry includes the following fields:

| Field                                 | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Contact First & Last Name** | The main point of contact for the group (e.g., “Jane Doe”)                            |
| **Email**                             | Used for confirmation or to resolve access issues                                     |
| **Phone Number**                      | For direct communication if needed at check-in                                        |
| **Guest Quantity**                    | Number of people this primary contact is bringing (e.g., “3” if it’s Jane + 2 guests) |

> 📝 You may list each individual guest separately with a quantity of 1—or group them under a single contact if they’re arriving together.
