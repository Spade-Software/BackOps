The **Credentials module** is a **global module** used to manage access passes, wristbands, badges, and other credentials for collaborators entering your event site.

It’s designed to ensure that every person on-site is properly identified, approved, and granted the correct level of access—supporting both security protocols and logistical coordination.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

From crew wristbands to artist laminates, credentials control who gets where, and when. The Credentials module enables collaborators to:

- Submit mass credential requests for their teams
- Specify credential types
- Provide pickup contact information for accountability and tracking

This module streamlines access management and helps prevent unauthorized site access.

### 📋 Submitting a Credential Request

Each credential request includes the following fields:

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credential Type**            | Selectable from a list defined by the **event administrator** (e.g., All Access, Crew, Artist, Vendor, Media)                                                              |
| **Quantity**                   | The number of passes being requested (e.g., “15 Crew Wristbands” for a full team)                                                                                          |
| **Pickup Contact Information** | Contact details for the individual responsible for collecting the credentials: <br> - **First Name** <br> - **Last Name** <br> - **Email Address** <br> - **Phone Number** |

> 🔐 _Credential types are fully customizable per event and can reflect varying levels of access (e.g., backstage, catering, FOH, roaming)._

### 🛠️ Configuration Options (for Admins)

- **Credential Types**: Create and manage all access categories based on site security and operational zones.
- **Pickup Verification**: Use name and contact information for identity verification and discrepancy resolution.
- **Audit Logging** _(optional future feature)_: Track who requested, picked up, and used each credential.

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- Giving production vendors bulk wristbands for their crew
- Managing artist credentials across different tiers of access
- Ensuring security staff can verify pickup representatives
- Centralizing contact info to resolve credentialing issues quickly

This is a strong module for access control, and one that will likely grow in complexity as BackOps expands. Ready for the next module whenever you are!
