The **Heavy Equipment module** is a **global module** used to manage requests for heavy machinery on-site. From forklifts to boom lifts, this tool helps organizers plan equipment needs efficiently—reducing cost, overlap, and logistical friction.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

Heavy equipment is critical for setup, teardown, and ongoing site operations. This module enables collaborators to:

- Request the equipment they need for their team or department
- Specify what type of equipment and when it’s needed
- Support smart resource planning by sharing scheduling info

---

### 📋 Submitting a Heavy Equipment Request

When collaborators submit a request, they’ll provide:

| Field              | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Equipment Name** | A name to help identify the use case or team (e.g., “Production Forklift”, “Stage Left Boomlift”, “Fencing Crew Loader”) |
| **Equipment Type** | Select from a list of types configured by the **event admin** (e.g., Forklift, Scissorlift, Boomlift, Frontloader)       |
| **Pickup Date**    | The day the equipment is needed on site                                                                                  |
| **Return Date**    | The day the equipment is expected to be released or returned                                                             |

> 🛠️ _All equipment types are configurable by the event administrator based on what’s available or being rented._

### 🔄 Why Scheduling Matters

Unlike other modules, **timing is especially important** with heavy equipment. Because many teams might only need gear for short windows (e.g., unloading a truck), this module helps planners:

- Spot overlaps and opportunities to **share resources**
- Reduce unnecessary rentals
- Avoid on-site congestion or scheduling conflicts

---

### 🛠️ Configuration Options (for Admins)

- **Equipment Types**: Create a list of all available heavy equipment types for your site.
- **Availability Logic** _(optional future feature)_: Use pickup/return data to forecast availability or conflicts.
- **Access Control**: Enable this module only for departments that handle or require heavy gear.

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- Managing forklift access across production, audio, and vendors
- Coordinating equipment usage by time slot to reduce rental costs
- Centralizing request tracking for load-in/out logistics
