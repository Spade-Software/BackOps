## üì° Radio Module

The **Radio module** is a **global module** used to manage communication equipment requests across your event. Radios are often centrally provided by the production team to ensure seamless, unified communication among staff, vendors, and crew.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

Radios are a mission-critical tool for real-time coordination on site. The Radio module enables collaborators to:

- Request the communication gear they need for their teams
- Specify the number and type of devices required
- Coordinate pickup and return logistics

By centralizing these requests, event organizers avoid the chaos of unmanaged, mismatched radio systems being brought in by separate teams.

### üìã Submitting a Radio Request

Each request includes the following fields:

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Pickup Date**           | When the radios are needed to be picked up on site                                                                                                                           |
