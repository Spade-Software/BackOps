The **Video module** is an **area module** used during artist advancing to outline video-related staffing, equipment, and content needs. Like other advancing modules, it uses the **Production Advance Response system** to clarify responsibility and cost ownership between the house and the artist.

This module also supports **file delivery** via a content dropbox, simplifying workflows for acts submitting digital assets like visuals, logos, or background graphics.

## Fields

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                | Type                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Video Operator**  | Indicates who will be operating video during the performance‚Äîeither house-supplied, artist-provided, or not applicable.                                    | Provider Only               |
| **Media Server**    | Declares who is supplying the media server, and who is covering the cost. Useful whether an artist brings a full system or requires the house to rent one. | Production Advance Response |
| **Notes**           | Freeform notes for the video setup‚Äîideal for things like adapter needs (e.g., HDMI to SDI), media server specs, or house screen resolutions.               | Free Text                   |
| **Content Dropbox** | Allows collaborators to **upload video files or stills** (e.g., MP4s, logos, graphic loops) for LED walls, IMAG screens, or video playback.                | File Upload                 |

> üí° _The Content Dropbox is especially useful for artists not bringing a full video team, but who want visuals displayed during their performance._

## Configuration (Admins)

- **Dropbox File Types & Size Limits**: Configure allowed formats (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.jpg`) and file size caps.
- **Approval Workflow** _(optional future feature)_: Route submitted video content for review by the video director or house engineer.
- **Media Server Library**: Predefine available server types (e.g., Resolume, Hippo, Disguise) for selection.

## Use Cases

- A DJ submits a 20-minute looping video via the dropbox and uses a house-supplied media server.
- An artist requests a media server and video op from the house, but brings backup USBs with failsafe content.
- A full touring act brings their own team, so both the operator and media server fields are marked ‚ÄúArtist,‚Äù with no content uploaded.
