#### **Scheduling**

- **Event Schedules:**

  - Added a unified scheduling system with calendars at multiple levels:

    - **Event Schedule:** High-level view of all event activities.
    - **User Schedule:** Personalized calendar of activities for each user.
    - **Collaborator Schedule:** View of activities assigned to specific collaborators.
    - **Area Schedule:** Location-specific calendars for better operational oversight.

  - Introduced a new schedule filtering experience, allowing users to mix and match relevant calendars for clear, focused views.

- **Activities:**

  - Create and manage activities with:

    - Name, description, start and end times.
    - Support for **all-day events**.
    - **Recurrence rules** (daily, weekly, monthly, or specific days of the week).

  - Associate activities with multiple **areas** (e.g., stages, zones).
  - Assign **organizers** (users and collaborators) with clear permissions—organizers can edit activities; non-organizers cannot.
  - Add **participants**:

    - Required participants: Those who must attend.
    - Optional participants: Those who should be informed but are not required.

  - Mark activities as **global**, making them visible across the event schedule for maximum awareness (e.g., doors open, all-staff meetings).

- **Time Frames:**

  - Introduced **time frames** for contextual highlights on the calendar:

    - Load-in, show days, load-out.
    - Access restriction periods (e.g., no vehicle traffic).
    - Location-specific contexts (e.g., cruise ports, “at sea” days).

  - Support for **naming**, **descriptions**, start and end times, and optional areas and participants.
  - Global time frames for event-wide visibility.
  - **Jump Points:** Time frames create sidebar navigation shortcuts for quick access to specific phases of the event.

- **Calendar Experience Enhancements:**

  - Calendar navigation is smoother and allows movement by 1 day in the week view
  - Scroll position is retained when switching calendar views and navigating between dates
  - Added Calendar sidebar
  - Added all day events
