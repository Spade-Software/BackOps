Welcome to the **BackOps Changelog** â€” your source for tracking updates, enhancements, and bug fixes across the BackOps platform.

## What is a Changelog?

A **changelog** is a chronological record of the changes made to a product or system over time. It helps users stay informed about new features, updates, and improvements, as well as any issues that have been resolved.

For those less familiar with software development, think of it like release notes or a version history â€” it tells you:

- What's new
- What's been improved
- What bugs were fixed
- When changes were made

## Why Check the Changelog?

Whether you're a day-to-day user, a production lead, or a technical collaborator, the changelog helps you:

- Understand how the platform is evolving
- Learn about new capabilities you can take advantage of
- Spot fixes that might resolve a past issue you encountered
- Plan for upcoming enhancements that impact your workflow

## How This Changelog is Organized

Each release of BackOps has its own page in this section. On each version page, youâ€™ll find:

- A release date
- Summary of new features
- Enhancements to existing features
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Notes for upcoming deprecations or behavior changes (if any)

> ðŸ”„ We continuously iterate on BackOps to make your event operations smoother and smarter â€” this changelog is where you'll see that progress in action.
