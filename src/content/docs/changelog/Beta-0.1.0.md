**Release Date:** `05-24-2025`
**Version:** `0.1.0-beta`

Welcome to the beginning of BackOps.

This initial beta release marks the foundation of the platform â€” the first public version of the application, built to centralize and streamline event operations from the ground up. Version `0.1.0` includes the core architecture and essential workflows designed to support complex events with clarity, flexibility, and control.

## âœ¨ What's Included

- **Modules:** Full support for the original suite of modules, including carts, credentials, radios, heavy equipment, labor, hospitality, and more.
- **Collaborators:** Add and manage vendors, artists, and crews with scoped access and role-based collaboration.
- **Areas:** Define and structure your event with customizable areas â€” ideal for mapping to stages, zones, or departments.
- **Requests:** Submit, review, and approve requests across all modules, tied to specific collaborators and areas.
- **Procurements:** Drag-and-drop procurement planning, request translation, and per-module shopping lists.
- **Orders:** RFQ generation, order status tracking, and quantity balancing across multiple vendors.

## ðŸš€ A Starting Point

This version is the baseline â€” the platform's **ground zero**. All future enhancements, refinements, and features will build from this release. Weâ€™re excited to grow with you and bring new functionality to life, one update at a time.
