**Release Date:** July 2, 2025

This release introduces the new **Rigging module**, expanding the BackOps advancing system to support rigging-specific needs for artists and production teams.

## üéØ New Features

- **Rigging Module (Artist Advancing)**  
  A dedicated advancing module for managing rigging needs‚Äîcollecting essential information such as item name, description, stage location, and total weight.
- **Approval Flow for Rigging Requests**  
  Rigging requests now follow a structured approval process, ensuring that all flown elements are reviewed and approved before showtime.

- **Line Items & Procurement Integration**  
  Users can specify which support gear (e.g., motors, truss) they need provided. These requests move into the resource approval pipeline and follow the same procurement path as other modules.

- **Rigging Notes Field**  
  Collaborators can add detailed notes or context, such as timing, rigging order of operations, or shared usage details.

- **Rigging Plans Upload**  
  Attach rigging drawings or structural diagrams directly to your rigging requests, providing technical documentation alongside request details.

## üß∞ Use Case Examples

- Artists can now submit rigging requests like ‚ÄúUpstage Softgoods‚Äù and request the house to provide four 10' truss sections and two 1-ton motors.
- Production can review all rigging weights and locations to plan load distribution and labor accordingly.
- Rigging drawings attached to requests help on-site teams prepare for safe and efficient installations.
- House teams can fulfill requested rigging gear through the same procurement and orders workflow already used in other modules.

This release marks another step in making BackOps a full-service advancing and logistics platform. As always, feedback is welcome as we continue to iterate.
