**Release Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Version:** `beta-0.4.1`

This minor update focuses on polishing and improving the data entry experience across a few key workflows, based on user feedback from the 0.4.0 release.

## 🛠️ Improvements

---

### 💬 **Dialog Enhancements for Decks, Set Pieces & Power Drops**

We've streamlined the dialog system for entering **Stage Decks**, **Set Pieces**, and **Power Drops**—making it faster and more intuitive to log technical details. Whether you're managing stage plots or power layouts, this update should reduce clicks and cognitive load.

---

### 📇 **More Flexible Contact Entry**

You can now create a **contact with only a single field filled out**. This is especially helpful when all you’ve got is an email, a phone number, or a job title like “Production Manager.”

This flexibility allows you to start with partial data and build it out over time, rather than waiting until you have a full name or full profile ready.

As always, thank you for continuing to shape BackOps through your feedback. More polish and performance improvements are on the way.
