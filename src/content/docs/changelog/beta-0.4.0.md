**Release Date:** July 9, 2025  
**Version:** `beta-0.4.0`

This release introduces a major upgrade to advancing workflows with the new **Advance Management** features. Built to support department leads and production teams, these tools streamline oversight, visibility, and action across all advancing modules.

## 🚀 Highlights

---

### 🎛️ **Advance Managers Dashboard**

A new central dashboard experience for users overseeing multiple collaborators. The dashboard provides:

- A collaborator-by-collaborator overview
- Counts of **incomplete modules**, **pending advance approvals**, and **resource approvals**
- Red indicators to spotlight immediate action items
- Hover-based detail previews and direct links to advance pages

Ideal for Lead Producers, Stage Managers, and anyone driving the completion of advance workflows.

---

### 📊 **Module Tabs for Department Leads**

Each module now includes an **Advanced Management tab**, allowing granular views of advancing data. Features include:

- Grouping by **collaborator** or **area**
- Column toggles for a custom view
- Quick filtering and deep linking into advance details

This makes it easy for department heads to stay on top of their specific domain (e.g., audio, lighting, labor).

---

### 🔐 **Granular Advance Permissions**

New permission structure to support scoped access:

- `event.advance.manager.*`: Full access to the entire Advanced Management section
- Module-specific permissions (e.g., `event.advance.manage.audio`, `event.advance.manage.video`, etc.)

Now you can grant visibility and action rights only where needed — perfect for distributed teams.

This release further empowers your team to manage complex advance operations with clarity and confidence. As always, more enhancements are on the way.
