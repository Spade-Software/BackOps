Every file in BackOps includes a **File Activity Log**, giving you a complete, chronological history of everything that has happened to that file. This feature is designed to provide transparency, accountability, and an easy way to track changes over time.

### 1. Accessing the File Activity Log

When you open a file:

- Look to the **left-hand sidebar**.
- At the top, you’ll see an **Activity** tab.
- Click **Activity** to reveal the file’s full history.

---

### 2. What the Activity Log Tracks

The File Activity Log provides a clear timeline of actions, including:

- **File creation**: See who originally created the file and when.
- **Version uploads**: Track every version added, along with the user who uploaded it.
- **Format changes**: Monitor any modifications to file formats.
- **Comments**: View when comments were added, updated, or resolved.
- **Associations**: Log changes to file sharing or permission updates.
- **Other actions**: Any additional key events related to the file.

This gives you a single source of truth for the file’s lifecycle.

### 3. Why It’s Useful

The Activity Log is particularly helpful when:

- You need to **identify who uploaded a specific version**.
- You want to **understand why a file was changed**.
- You’re investigating the **timeline of a file’s updates**.
- You’re collaborating with a team and need **accountability for edits and reviews**.

With the log, you no longer need to rely on guesswork or email trails—everything you need is in one place.

### 4. Best Practices

- **Check the Activity Log before asking questions.** If you’re unsure who made a change, the log has the answer.
- **Use it for audit purposes.** The log is a reliable record of all file activity.
- **Pair it with the review workflow.** Combine activity tracking with reviews and comments to fully understand a file’s evolution.

By using the File Activity Log, you gain complete visibility into a file’s history, helping your team work with confidence and clarity.
