## Why We Rethought File Management

File management is at the heart of live event production. From drafting rigging plots to distributing schedules and sharing technical documents, files are one of the primary ways production teams communicate and collaborate.

When we set out to build BackOps, we knew we wanted the platform to be a **one-stop shop** for production workflows—and that meant bringing file management into the platform. But simply replicating Dropbox or Google Drive wasn’t enough. We wanted to solve the very real problems production teams face when managing files.

## The Problems with Traditional File Management

Through years of working in the industry, we kept running into the same pain points:

### 1. **Multiple Formats**

A single file often exists in multiple formats:

- A **Vectorworks (.vwx)** file for drafting
- A **PDF** export for quick review
- A **DWG** or **MVR** for other teams
- Sometimes even images or additional exports

In traditional file systems, these live as separate files scattered across folders. You end up creating subfolder after subfolder just to keep them grouped, and even then it’s easy for things to get lost or disorganized.

### 2. **Version Changes**

Files change—a lot. Whether it’s a rigging plot, a stage layout, or a vendor schedule, you’ll see filenames like:

```

Stage_Rigging_v1.pdf
Stage_Rigging_v2.pdf
Stage_Rigging_FINAL.pdf
Stage_Rigging_FINAL_FINAL.pdf

```

Traditional tools push teams toward creating archives or manual version folders, but all it takes is one misplaced upload and suddenly you don’t know what’s actually the latest version.

### 3. **Fragmented Workflows**

Even with well-organized cloud storage, production teams still bounce between multiple tools to manage files, approvals, and communication. Every time you leave your platform to hunt for a file or request feedback in email threads, it slows the production workflow down.

## Our Approach

BackOps was built to fix this. By integrating file management directly into the platform, we eliminated the need to jump between tools—and we took the opportunity to solve the core problems above.

Here’s how we approached it:

- **Files with Versions**: Instead of manually creating archive folders, BackOps treats every file as a single object that can evolve over time. Upload a new version, and it’s automatically tracked.
- **Formats in One Place**: Keep every format of a file together. A single rigging drawing can contain its .vwx file, its PDF export, and its MVR format, all under one file record.
- **Built-in Reviews & Approvals**: Assign reviewers, collect approvals, and add comments directly in the file. No more scattered email chains.
- **One Platform, One Workflow**: With files living in BackOps, everything stays connected to your events, areas, collaborators, and production data.

## The Result

With BackOps, you can manage files the way production teams actually work—without the folder sprawl, version confusion, or tool-switching headaches.

This isn’t just file storage. This is **production-ready file management**, purpose-built for the live events industry.
