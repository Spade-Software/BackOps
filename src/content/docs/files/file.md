The **Files Explorer** is your starting point for reviewing and managing files. This interface is designed to be intuitive and powerful, allowing users to organize, collaborate on, and approve files with clear traceability and access control.

---

## Explorer View

When you first navigate to the Files section, you’ll land on the **Explorer View**—a table showing all the files you have access to. For each file, you'll see:

- **Name & Description**
- **Approval Status**
- **Associations** (users, collaborators, and areas)
- **Versions**

From here, you can either:

- **Double-click the file row** to open the full file view, or
- **Click directly on a version** to jump to that specific version.

---

## File Detail View

Once inside a file, you gain access to a deeper set of tools and information:

### Associations

Files can be **associated** with:

- **Areas** – so the file appears when managing that specific area (e.g., rigging plot linked to Main Stage)
- **Collaborators** – to indicate the artist or vendor contributing to or affected by the file
- **Users** – who may serve as reviewers, editors, or viewers

Associations help determine visibility, permissions, and relevance within your event’s structure.

### Reviews & Approvals

In the **right-hand sidebar**, you’ll find the **Reviewer Panel**:

- Add users as **required reviewers**
- View real-time approval status
- Collect **feedback** via comments
- Review is **version-specific**, so each new upload requires fresh approvals

> 🔒 A file is only marked as “Approved” when all required reviewers have submitted their approval.

---

### Activity Log

In the **left-hand sidebar**, the **Activity Log** offers a complete audit trail:

- New versions & formats uploaded
- Reviewers added/removed
- Comments made
- Permissions changed
- Approvals submitted

This log allows teams to see exactly how a file has evolved and who’s participated in its review.

---

### Versions & Formats

At the center of the page is your file viewer and version navigator:

- Switch between **file versions** to review past work
- View or download different **formats** (PDF, VWX, MVR, images, etc.)
- Add new versions as updates become available

Every version retains its own set of formats, reviewers, comments, and activity.
