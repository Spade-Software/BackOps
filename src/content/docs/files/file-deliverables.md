Deliverables are a special type of file in BackOps designed to help you track and manage the files you need from collaborators. Instead of uploading an existing file, you create a placeholder for a file that will be delivered later. This placeholder includes all the same functionality as a standard file—comments, reviews, versioning, and formats—but adds key features specifically for managing assignments and deadlines.

### **How Deliverables Work**

When you click **New → Deliverable**, you’ll be able to:

- **Create a file placeholder** – No versions or formats are uploaded initially.
- **Assign it to a collaborator** – Identify who is responsible for providing the file.
- **Set a due date** – Give the collaborator a clear deadline.
- **Add a description** – Use this space to define requirements or acceptance criteria, so the collaborator knows exactly what’s expected.

Once created, the deliverable will appear on the assigned collaborator’s dashboard, ensuring visibility and accountability. When the collaborator uploads the file, it becomes part of the deliverable activity log, keeping everything in one place.

### **Example Use Case**

Imagine you’re working on a show and need drawings from your production company to submit for permits. Instead of waiting for an email attachment, you:

1. Create a deliverable called **“Rigging Drawings for Permit Submission.”**
2. Assign it to the production company collaborator.
3. Add a due date.
4. Write in the description:

   > “Drawings must include all points, top and bottom hook weights, and be drawn to scale with dimensions.”

This makes it clear to your collaborator what they owe you, when it’s due, and what it must include. Once uploaded, you can immediately begin commenting, requesting revisions, and ultimately approving the deliverable.

### **Why Deliverables Matter**

Deliverables turn file collection from a messy, ad-hoc process into a structured workflow:

- No more hunting through email chains for attachments.
- Clear accountability for who owes what.
- Easy tracking of deadlines and requirements.
- Faster feedback and approvals directly in BackOps.

With deliverables, you get a single, organized location to request, collect, and approve files—keeping production workflows moving smoothly and reducing the risk of missed handoffs.
