**Procurement** is how BackOps turns approved requests into action. Once collaborators submit their needs and they pass through the **advancing** and **approval** stages, it’s time to **procure** the actual resources—gear, equipment, labor, and more.

---

### 🔁 Procurement Flow Overview

1. **Resource Approval**

   - Items requiring procurement are first approved by a **Resource Manager** after advancing.

2. **Request Pool**

   - Approved items appear in a **requests list**—a centralized view of what collaborators say they need.

3. **Translation**

   - Resource Managers **translate** requests into a practical **procurement list**.
     This is your **shopping list**—a realistic version of what actually needs to be sourced.

4. **Order Creation**

   - Items from the procurement list are grouped into **orders**.
   - Orders are then used to generate **RFQs (Requests for Quote)** and are sent to vendors for fulfillment.

### 🧠 Why Translation Matters

There is rarely a 1:1 match between requests and what’s procured.

> **Example**:
> Five artists request a forklift.
> Rather than order five forklifts, you translate those needs into **2 shared forklifts per area**.

The translation step helps:

- Eliminate redundancy
- Allocate shared resources effectively
- Convert requests into realistic and cost-effective procurement actions

### 🖥 Procurement Interface

The Procurement section has **three main views**:

| View                  | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Requests**          | View all resource-level approved requests by module                      |
| **Procurement Lists** | Manage procurement lists (aka shopping lists), group and refine requests |
| **Orders**            | Build vendor orders, generate RFQs, and track fulfillment                |

Each view supports a step in the procurement workflow—from initial intake to vendor communication.

### 🚀 Summary

Procurement in BackOps closes the loop between planning and execution:

- Streamlines **resource allocation**
- Centralizes **purchasing workflows**
- Enables vendor coordination through **RFQs and orders**
