The **Requests** tab is the starting point for the procurement workflow in BackOps. It provides a centralized view of all items submitted through advancing that **may require resource procurement**.

---

## Navigating the Requests Tab

When you visit the Procurement page, you’ll land on the **Requests** tab by default.

- Across the top of the page, you’ll see **tabs for each module** (e.g., Lighting, Labor, Power).
- Selecting a module filters the view to show **only the requests** associated with that category.

---

## Filter & manage requests

Use filters to quickly locate requests by status:

- **All** – See every request submitted
- **Needs Advance Approval** – Awaiting approval from an Advance Manager
- **Needs Resource Approval** – Awaiting Resource Manager sign-off
- **Approved** – Cleared for procurement list inclusion
- **Denied** – Not moving forward

You can also **customize table columns** to show only the data most relevant to your role.

---

## Approving requests

Each request row shows the current status of:

- **Advance Approval**
- **Resource Approval**

If action is required, buttons are available directly within the row to:

- **Approve**
- **Deny**
- **Complete Final Advance Entries**

---

## Module specific

This streamlined interface is replicated for every module tab, giving you a **module-specific view of procurement requests** while maintaining consistent actions and approval flows.

---

## Summary

The Requests tab is your **control center** for all incoming procurement needs—making it easy to track, manage, and take action on items before they move into procurement lists or orders.
