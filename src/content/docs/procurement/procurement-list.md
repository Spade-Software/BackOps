Once requests are approved, the next step is to translate them into actual **procurement actions**—this happens in the **Procurement List** tab. Think of this as your **shopping list builder** for the event.

---

### 🧭 Navigating the Procurement List

At the top of the page, you’ll see **tabs for each module** (e.g., Lighting, Labor, Power). Each tab shows:

- All **approved requests** for that module (left side)
- All current **procurement items** (right side)

This layout enables **resource managers** to focus on their specific domain and build out procurements accordingly.

---

### 🧱 Building Procurements

You have two options:

1. **Create from Requests**:

   - Select one or more approved requests from the left.
   - Click **Create Procurement** to auto-assign them into a new procurement item.
   - Fill in the procurement form, which is **customized per module**.

2. **Start Blank**:

   - Click **Create Procurement** without selecting requests.
   - Fill in procurement details manually, then **drag and drop requests** onto it later.

---

### 🔁 Assigning Requests to Procurements

Use **drag-and-drop** to assign approved requests (left) to procurements (right). This action signals:

> “This procurement will fulfill this request.”

You can assign **multiple requests** to a single procurement—useful for shared resources like forklifts, radios, or labor teams.

### 🧠 Real-World Example: Forklift Sharing

- Five artists request a forklift.
- You create a procurement named **Stage 1 Forklift**, specifying a **15k forklift, Qty: 1**.
- Drag all five requests into that procurement.
- Now one forklift is fulfilling all five requests—a perfect example of **translation**.

### 🛠️ Managing Procurements

- Click any procurement to:

  - View linked requests
  - Edit procurement details
  - Adjust quantities as needed

This flexibility supports real-world decision-making as needs evolve.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

The **Procurement List** bridges the gap between collaborator needs and actual orders. It’s where **strategy meets execution**, giving you total control over how event requests turn into real-world resources.
