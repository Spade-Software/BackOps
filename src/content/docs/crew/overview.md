The Crewing Module unifies crew, contact, and user management into a single streamlined workflow inside BackOps.

It gives event teams the ability to:

- Centralize crew information
- Define custom data requirements
- Delegate management responsibilities with granular permissions
- Track and resolve missing information quickly

The module replaces the previous contact management system, combining it with user management for a more integrated experience.
