### Crew Page

The Event Crew Page provides a full overview of every crew member assigned to your event.

**Features:**

- View all crew members in one table.
- Toggle columns to display only the data you need (e.g., job titles, meal preferences, certification dates).
- Available only to **Event Admins** to ensure sensitive information is protected.

**Example:**

If you only need to see crew names, meal preference, and arrival dates, you can hide all other columns for a cleaner view.

### Custom Attributes

Custom attributes allow you to collect exactly the crew information your event requires.

**Features:**

- Define attributes at the **event level**, which then trickle down to collaborators and crew members.
  - **note:** by default, attributes added at the event level don't apply to all crew members, you have to assign them to each collaborator to apply
- Supported field types:
    - **Text** (e.g., “T-Shirt Size”)
    - **Select** (dropdown with your own list of options, e.g., “Meal Preference: Standard / Paleo / Vegan")
    - **Date/Time** (e.g., “Arrival Date”)
- Flexible enough for logistical details, compliance requirements, or event-specific needs.

**Use Case:**

A music festival might require “Emergency Contact Number” (text), “Stage Access Level” (select), and “Safety Training Completion Date” (date).
