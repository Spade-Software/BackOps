### Collaborator Dashboard – Missing Crew Info Card

Gives collaborators immediate visibility into what crew data is incomplete.

**Features:**

- Displays crew members missing required information.
- Links directly to the crew member’s profile for quick updates.

**Example:**

If five people are missing their “On-Site Phone Number,” they’ll appear in this card until they update it.
