### Crew Member Custom Settings

When you need to override default settings for a specific person:

**Features:**

- Access the crew memberâ€™s page and use the 3-dot menu in the top right.
- Add, remove, or change Required and Crew Provided flags.
- Customizations override collaborator defaults but still require attributes to be set at the event level first.

**Example:**

If one member of a team needs special clearance or medical documentation, you can add a one-off required attribute for them.
