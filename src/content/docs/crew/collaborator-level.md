### Crew Page

Collaborators can add crew members for their assigned areas.

**Features:**

- Add crew individually or bulk invite by email.
- If a crew member doesn’t have an account, they can be added without one and invited later.
- Toggle columns so you can always see information that is important to you.
- Fields that are required and missing will show a red indicator

**Example:**

A vendor can invite their entire team using the bulk invite by email. The manager can delegate the information collection to each team member instead of having to enter everything themselves.

### Collaborator Settings – Crewing Attributes

Collaborators can set **default attributes** for their crew members, based on the event-level options.

**Features:**

- **Required** attributes appear as incomplete in both the dashboard and the crew table until filled in.
- **Crew Provided** attributes indicate that the crew member is expected to provide this information themselves (if they have an account).
- Defaults only apply to crew members added after the defaults are set.
- All available attributes come from the **event configuration**.

**Example:**

A stage manager might mark “T-Shirt Size” as a required field that is crew-provided so each member enters their own size.

### Permissions Management

Delegate crew management responsibilities to others so you can focus on what matters most.

**Features:**

- Assign the “Crew Manage” permission to a user on the collaborator.
- This allows them to configure and manage crew without access to unrelated event settings.

**Example:**

A vendor manager could delegate crew management and invitation responsibilities to their assistant's account.
