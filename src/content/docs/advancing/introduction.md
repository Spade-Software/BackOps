**Advancing** is one of the most critical workflows in BackOps. Itâ€™s how collaborators tell you what they need to succeed at your event.

### ðŸ“Œ What Is Advancing?

In live production, **advancing** refers to the process of collecting detailed logistical and technical information from collaborators before an event begins.

In BackOps, advancing is:

- **Modular** â€“ Broken down by **Global** and **Area Modules**
- **Collaborator-driven** â€“ Each collaborator fills out their needs for the modules theyâ€™ve been assigned
- **Progress-tracked** â€“ Completion is visualized through per-module progress bars and status indicators

### ðŸ§© How It Works

Each **Module** (e.g., Lighting, Labor, Credentials) provides a structured interface for collaborators to input:

- Personnel and contact information
- Equipment or gear requests
- Technical specifications
- Scheduling needs
- Hospitality or access requirements
- And moreâ€¦

The system automatically tracks progress and flags **required modules**, helping managers stay on top of whatâ€™s missing and follow up as needed.

### âœ… Why It Matters

BackOps turns chaotic back-and-forth emails and spreadsheets into a **centralized, trackable, and streamlined process**.
By the time you hit show day, everyone knows whatâ€™s expectedâ€”because itâ€™s all been advanced.
