**Advancing** is one of the most critical workflows in BackOps. It’s how collaborators tell you what they need to succeed at your event.

## What is advancing

In live production, **advancing** refers to the process of collecting detailed logistical and technical information from collaborators before an event begins.

In BackOps, advancing is:

- **Modular** – Broken down by **Global** and **Area Modules**
- **Collaborator-driven** – Each collaborator fills out their needs for the modules they’ve been assigned
- **Progress-tracked** – Completion is visualized through per-module progress bars and status indicators

## How it works

Each **Module** (e.g., Lighting, Labor, Credentials) provides a structured interface for collaborators to input:

- Crew information
- Equipment or gear requests
- Technical specifications
- Scheduling needs
- Hospitality or access requirements
- And more…

The system automatically tracks progress and flags **required modules**, helping managers stay on top of what’s missing and follow up as needed.

## Why it matters

BackOps turns chaotic back-and-forth emails and spreadsheets into a **centralized, trackable, and streamlined process**.
By the time you hit show day, everyone knows what’s expected—because it’s all been advanced.
