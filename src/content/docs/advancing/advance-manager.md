The **Advance Managers Dashboard** provides a centralized view of all collaborators for which a user has **advance management responsibilities**. Itâ€™s designed to help advance managers monitor progress, identify outstanding needs, and take action on incomplete or unapproved items.

This feature is especially useful for roles overseeing multiple artists or departmentsâ€”offering a **quick-glance status** and actionable insights.

## Dashboard Overview

When accessing the dashboard, users will see a **card for each collaborator** they are responsible for. Each card includes:

| Field                       | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incomplete Modules**      | Number of modules that the collaborator has not yet filled out.                           |
| **Needs Advance Approval**  | Count of requests requiring advance approval (actionable by the advance manager).         |
| **Needs Resource Approval** | Count of requests pending resource approval (typically owned by departments/procurement). |

> ðŸ”´ **Red-highlighted numbers** indicate areas where action is required from the advance manager.

## Interactions

- **Hover for Details**: Hover over any of the three stats to get a detailed breakdown (e.g., which modules are incomplete and their percent completion).
- **Click to Drill Down**: Click any stat to jump directly to the relevant dashboard for that collaboratorâ€”offering access to full module breakdowns, request lists, and approval tools.

---

## Use Cases

- A **stage manager** monitoring five artists can quickly identify who still has incomplete advances.
- A **department lead** with advance responsibilities can follow up on missing approvals or stalled procurement.
- A **production coordinator** can spot trends or bottlenecks across multiple collaborators at once.

This dashboard empowers users to stay on top of advancing without clicking through each collaborator one by oneâ€”centralizing action items for more efficient event prep.

Here's an addition to the **Advance Managers Dashboard** documentation, expanding on the **Module Tabs** functionality to follow your voice and documentation style:

## Module Tabs

Beyond the dashboard, the **Advance Management section** of the platform includes dedicated **tabs for each advancing module** (e.g., Audio, Video, Labor, Rigging). These pages give you **high-level visibility** across all collaborators and areas for that specific domain.

Each module tab supports:

- **Sorting by Collaborator or Area**: View responses grouped by who submitted them or where they're assigned.
- **Column Controls**: Hide or reveal columns to focus on just the data you need.
- **Click-to-Drill**: Click into any cell to jump directly to the associated advance request for full detail and editing.

This layout makes it **easy for department leads** to focus only on their area of responsibility.

### Departmental Use Case Examples

- An **audio lead** can visit the Audio tab to view all RF, console, and engineer needs across the event at a glance.
- A **video coordinator** can check which artists are providing media servers.
- A **rigging supervisor** can scan through all rigging requests, weights, and approval statuses from a single interface.

Each module page acts as a **live, centralized summary** of the departmentâ€™s advancing statusâ€”making it easy to track progress, spot missing information, and take action.
