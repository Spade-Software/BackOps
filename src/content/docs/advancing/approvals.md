As collaborators submit information during advancing, many of their inputs trigger **approval workflows**—ensuring the right people review, approve, or coordinate key details and resource needs.

---

## Types of advance inputs

Not all information in the advance requires approval. There are three main categories:

| Type                   | Description                                                                | Approval Required? |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Informational Only** | Notes, files, contact details, etc. — useful context with no action needed | ❌ No              |
| **Advance Approval**   | Items that collaborators are bringing and need permission for              | ✅ Yes – 1 step    |
| **Resource Approval**  | Items that must be sourced or provided by the event                        | ✅ Yes – 2 steps   |

### How approval types are determined

Approval logic is determined by the **Production Advance Response** (Provider & Payor):

| Provider   | Payor          | Approval Type         |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| **Artist** | Any            | **Advance Approval**  |
| **House**  | House/Artist   | **Resource Approval** |
| **House**  | Not Applicable | ❌ No Approval        |
| **NA**     | Any            | ❌ No Approval        |

> 💡 Items with a **Provider = Artist** only need sign-off from the Advance Manager.

> 💡 Items with **Provider = House** and a real Payor need to be **procured**, thus require two approvals.

## Examples

| Scenario                             | Approval Type      | Who Approves?                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Artist bringing a riser              | Advance Approval   | Advance Manager (e.g., Stage Manager)     |
| Vendor requests house-provided radio | Resource Approval  | 1. Advance Manager<br>2. Resource Manager |
| Artist shares contact list           | Informational Only | No approval needed                        |
| Item marked NA                       | No Approval        | Automatically bypassed                    |

## Approval Roles & Flow

| Approval Type         | Step 1          | Step 2           |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **Advance Approval**  | Advance Manager | —                |
| **Resource Approval** | Advance Manager | Resource Manager |

> 💡 _Advance Managers_ typically represent department leads (e.g., stage managers).

> 💡 _Resource Managers_ are responsible for actually obtaining or coordinating delivery of event-supplied resources (e.g., power, radios, heavy equipment).

---

## Summary

The approval system ensures proper coordination and accountability:

- **Advance Managers** vet and track incoming collaborator needs.
- **Resource Managers** confirm availability and manage procurement.
- **Clear logic** based on provider/payor ensures consistency across modules.
