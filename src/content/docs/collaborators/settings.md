The **Collaborator Settings** tab allows event organizers to manage collaborator-level configuration, including naming, user access, and module assignments. This is where you define what a collaborator can do, what they’re responsible for, and who has access on their behalf.

---

## General

This tab allows for basic collaborator management:

- **Update Collaborator Name**
  Rename the collaborator if needed (e.g., fix typos or clarify organization names).

- **Delete Collaborator**
  You may delete a collaborator _only if doing so will not disrupt critical event data_.

  - Deletion may be **blocked** if the collaborator has already submitted advancing info, has attached procurement items, or is tied to downstream processes.
  - This safeguard prevents data loss or inconsistencies in your event workflow.

> 🛑 _Use caution when deleting collaborators. All request information will be deleted, BUT users will need to manually update procurement and order quantities._

---

## Modules

This tab defines which modules the collaborator can see and interact with.

You’ll see:

- A full list of **global modules**
- A breakdown of **each area** and the modules available in those areas

For each module, you can:

- **Enable or disable** the module for that collaborator
- **Mark modules as required**, which causes them to be tracked as part of that collaborator’s **advance completion progress**

> ✅ _Use this tab to tailor each collaborator’s interface to their role—no clutter, no confusion._

---

## Users

This is where you manage **user access** for the collaborator’s team.

- **Invite users** by email:

  - If the email belongs to an existing BackOps user, they are immediately granted access.
  - If the user is new to BackOps, they’ll receive an invitation to create an account and gain access upon registration.

- **View status** of invited users in a structured table:

  - Includes name (if known), email, and account status (e.g., Pending, Active)

> ✉️ _This allows you to build a full team under each collaborator—tour managers, tech leads, vendor reps, and more._
