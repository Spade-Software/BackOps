The **Schedule tab** in a collaboratorâ€™s profile provides a filtered view of the event calendarâ€”showing **only the activities directly associated with that specific collaborator**. Itâ€™s a streamlined, focused tool for tracking and managing all time-based commitments related to that team or individual.

### ðŸ§­ How It Works

The Collaborator Schedule functions similarly to the **Master Event Schedule**, but with a narrower scope:

- Youâ€™ll only see events, activities, and time blocks assigned to this collaborator
- This includes things like load-in times, advance calls, on-site windows, or meetings
- Any events added through this tab are automatically tied **only to this collaborator**, not the entire event

---

### ðŸ“† Calendar Views

Users can toggle between different timeframes for flexible planning:

- **Day View**
- **Week View**
- **Month View**

Each view is scrollable, so you can easily browse past or upcoming activity related to this collaborator.

### âž• Use Cases

This tab is ideal for:

- Scheduling and tracking advance calls
- Assigning load-in/load-out times
- Logging site arrival and departure windows
- Adding internal meetings, rehearsals, or crew call times specific to one group
