**Collaborators** are how BackOps represents the companies and people working together to make your event happen. Whether itâ€™s a vendor, artist team, crew lead, or production company, each collaborator serves as a container for the individuals and actions associated with that group.

### ðŸ§­ What is a Collaborator?

At a high level, a **Collaborator** represents an external entity participating in your event. This could be:

- A production company
- A food or beverage vendor
- An artist or artist management team
- The eventâ€™s core producing entity

Each **User** in BackOps is tied to a Collaborator. This means permissions, access, and requests are scoped based on their role within that specific organization.

### ðŸ”— Example

At a music festival:

- The **Lighting Vendor** is one collaborator
- **Artist Aâ€™s Management Team** is another
- The **Food Court Vendor** is a third
- The **Festival Producer** is also a collaborator with internal staff attached

Each of these collaborators can have one or more users working within BackOps on their behalf.

## ðŸ§­ Collaborator Interface

When you select a collaborator in BackOps, youâ€™ll land on their **collaborator dashbaord**, with tabs across the top for several key sections:

- **Dashboard** â€“ A summary view of activity, requests, and status
- **Advancing** â€“ Used to submit technical needs and interact with assigned modules
- **Schedule** â€“ A space to outline timelines, key dates, or work blocks
- **Contacts** â€“ Shows contact info for key members of the collaborators team
- **Settings** â€“ Manage user roles, access, and collaborator-specific preferences
