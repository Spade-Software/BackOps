The **Collaborator Dashboard** is the central hub for monitoring each collaborator’s activity, progress, and key information at a glance. It provides a quick and actionable overview for both internal staff and collaborating users, helping everyone stay aligned and on schedule.

## Advance Progress Overview

At the top left of the dashboard is the **Advance Progress** section, which gives a visual breakdown of the collaborator’s completion status across all assigned modules.

Here’s how it works:

- **Global Modules Box**: Shows progress on modules assigned across the entire event (e.g., Credentials, Labor, Vehicles).
- **Area Boxes**: Each additional box corresponds to a specific area (e.g., Main Stage, VIP Lounge) where the collaborator has assigned modules.
- **Modules Inside Each Box**: Each visible icon or block represents one module.

### Required Modules

- Modules marked with a **star (★)** are **required**.
- These modules count toward the collaborator’s overall **advance completion percentage**.
- If a required module is incomplete, it will negatively impact the collaborator’s progress score.

### Progress Bars

Each module has a built-in progress bar to show how much of that module has been filled out:

- **Red** = Not Started (and Required)
- **Yellow** = In Progress
- **Green** = Complete

This makes it easy to spot what’s missing and where follow-up may be needed.

## Contacts

Beneath the advance progress section is the **Contacts Box**, a quick-reference panel listing key users within that collaborator group.

For each contact, you’ll see:

- **Name**
- **Role/Title** (e.g., Tour Manager, Site Lead)
- **Email Address** (for fast outreach)

This helps event teams quickly identify and communicate with the right person.

## Collaborator Schedule

Along the right side of the dashboard is the **Collaborator Schedule View**, showing any **scheduled activities, assignments, or time blocks** relevant to that collaborator.

- Scrollable list of events tied to that user or organization
- Ideal for quickly checking load-in times, call times, or scheduled advances

This dashboard brings clarity to complexity—letting teams track advancing, contact info, and scheduling from a single unified view.
