The **Advancing tab** is where collaborators submit key details for their assigned modules—whether at the global event level or tied to specific areas (like a stage, room, or activation zone). This is the core workspace for **fulfilling advancing responsibilities** in BackOps.

### 🧭 Sidebar Navigation (Left Panel)

The left-hand sidebar provides a **collapsible, categorized list** of all modules assigned to the collaborator:

- **Global Modules**
  Displayed at the top of the sidebar and grouped together (e.g., Credentials, Vehicles, Labor).

- **Area Modules**
  Grouped below the globals, each section represents a specific **area** the collaborator is assigned to (e.g., “Main Stage”, “VIP Lounge”). Each area expands to show its corresponding modules (e.g., Audio, Lighting, Hospitality).

This makes it easy for collaborators to navigate through their responsibilities without getting overwhelmed.

### 📝 Module Access and Entry

Clicking on any module in the sidebar opens that module’s **Advancing Form**, where collaborators can:

- View current progress or status
- Enter new information or update existing details
- See which fields are required or incomplete

Each module is tailored to its function, and users will only see the fields relevant to their assigned responsibilities.

> 💡 Required fields or modules are highlighted to make completion easier and faster.

### 🗒️ Notes Section

Many modules include a **Notes field** on the left-hand side of the screen. This is used for:

- Providing additional context not captured by standard fields
- Leaving messages or clarifications for the event team
- Tracking special requests or conditional details

These notes help maintain a shared understanding between collaborators and organizers without the need for separate emails or external docs.

The Advancing tab is your collaborator’s workspace—organized, focused, and tied directly into the broader event workflow.
