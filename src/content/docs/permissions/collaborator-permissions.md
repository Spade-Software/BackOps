**Collaborator Permissions** govern what actions a user can take for a specific collaborator. These permissions are assigned _per collaborator_, making them ideal for tailoring access based on team roles and responsibilities. For example, a stage manager might have full advancing access to the artists they manage, while having only read-only access to others.

This flexibility allows you to grant granular control over collaborator data and actions, ensuring that users only have access to what they need.
